Hi! I'm Cristiano Saltori, an enthusiastic researcher in computer vision, artificial intelligence and, in general, in love with science and technology.
Currently, I'm pursuing a Ph.D. in deep learning for computer vision with a focus in 3D vision, perception, and domain adaptation.
When not working, you will find me climbing or hiking on the mountains.

This is my personal webpage and, through the years, I'll be uploading my career's steps, research discoveries, travels and news!
